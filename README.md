# Covid_19-Prediction-and-future-Forecasting-in-India

Forecasting real-time data using Machine learning has proved its significance in expecting better outcomes to improve future decision-making. ML models have been used in many application areas that require recognition and emphasization of harmful aspects. In this study we have tried to use Machine Learning models to forecast upcoming COVID-19 cases in India, considering the problem to be a burning topic at the current time. In general, three Machine Learning models, Random Forest Regressor, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and FB Prophet model have been discussed to forecast the number of Active cases for the next 30 days. The results produced by the study prove it is a good technique to use these models for the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The final results obtained after training all the 3 models using Covid19 India dataset are as below:

In this work, ML based model has been designed for foretelling the risk of COVID-19 outburst in India. The model outlines the dataset which contains the daily reported cases and advances predictions for the forthcoming 30 days using machine learning algorithms. The study results prove that the Random Forest regressor performs comparatively better than other models for the given dataset.
